Authors: [Austin Fahsl](https://github.com/fahslaj),

The goal of the overall project is to create a very small, but working, operating system.

## Milestone notes
### Milestone 5
Please note that the excuteProgram method in kernel.c still takes two
parameters, however this is because the second parameter is purely used by the
kernel itself.  It is used since the blocking execute is very similar so the
methods were just combined and the second parameter is the differentiator.
